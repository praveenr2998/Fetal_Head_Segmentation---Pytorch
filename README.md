# Fetal_Head_Segmentation---Pytorch
Segmentation of fetal head from ultrasonic images using computer vision. I have used Segnet architecture to train the model.

Dataset source : https://zenodo.org/record/1322001#.XcX1jk9KhhE, download train_set.zip and test_set.zip

#### If you want to directly run the model the weights.pt file is in models folder, download the test_zip file and run test.py to generate segmented output. 

Step by step procedures are provided in "train.ipynb" in notebooks folder.
